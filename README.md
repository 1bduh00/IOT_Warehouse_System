system IOT pour la gestion d'un warehouse




--------Azure IoT Hub:
Acts as the central communication hub, securely connecting and managing IoT devices.
Receives device telemetry data and events.
Routes messages to downstream services based on rules or event types.


--------Azure Functions:
Serverless functions triggered by device messages or events.
Perform real-time data processing, cleaning, validation, and enrichment.
Trigger alerts or actions based on business logic.
Store processed data in the database.
Send relevant data or notifications to the web app.


--------Database:
Stores processed data for historical analysis, queries, and further processing.
Common choices: Cosmos DB, SQL Database, Time Series Insights.


--------Web App:
Provides a user interface for interaction with the IoT solution.
Displays device data and insights in real-time.
Allows users to control devices or configure settings.
Offers data visualization and analysis capabilities.


--------Communication Flow:

Devices -> Azure IoT Hub: Devices send telemetry data and events to IoT Hub.
Azure IoT Hub -> Azure Functions: IoT Hub routes messages to Functions based on rules or event types.
Azure Functions -> Database: Functions store processed data in the database.
Azure Functions -> Web App: Functions send relevant data or notifications to the web app.


====>Example: Predictive Maintenance Scenario

Devices: Sensors on industrial equipment collect data like temperature, vibration, and pressure.
Azure IoT Hub: Receives device data and routes it to Functions for analysis.
Azure Functions: Analyze sensor readings in real-time to detect potential faults.
Database: Stores historical sensor data for trend analysis and maintenance records.
Web App: Displays equipment health status, alerts maintenance teams of potential issues, and provides historical insights for maintenance planning.
